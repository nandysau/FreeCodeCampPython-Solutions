# Build an RPG Character
# In this lab you will practice the basics of Python by building a small app that creates a character for an RPG adventure.

# Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

# User Stories:

# You should have a function named create_character.
# The function should accept, in order, a character name followed by three stats: strength, intelligence, and charisma.
# The character name should be validated:
# If the character name is not a string, the function should return The character name should be a string.
# If the character name is an empty string, the function should return The character should have a name.
# If the character name is longer than 10 characters, the function should return The character name is too long.
# If the character name contains spaces, the function should return The character name should not contain spaces.
# The stats should also be validated:
# If one or more stats are not integers, the function should return All stats should be integers.
# If one or more stats are less than 1, the function should return All stats should be no less than 1.
# If one or more stats are more than 4, the function should return All stats should be no more than 4.
# If the sum of all stats is different than 7, the function should return The character should start with 7 points.
# If all values pass the verification, the function should return a string with four lines:
# the first line should contain the character name
# lines 2-4 should start with the stat abbreviation, STR, INT or CHA (in this order), then a space, and then a number of full dots (●) equal to the value of the stat, and a number of empty dots (○) to reach 10. Example: if the value of strength is 3 there must be 3 full dots followed by 7 empty dots. The dots are given in the editor.
# Here's the string that should be returned by create_character('ren', 4, 2, 1):

# Example Code
# ren
# STR ●●●●○○○○○○
# INT ●●○○○○○○○○
# CHA ●○○○○○○○○○
# NOTE: while str and int are common abbreviations for the stats, remember that those are reserved keywords in Python and should not be used as variable names.

full_dot = '●'
empty_dot = '○'
